## Creator's recommendation

Conduct a **live poll** (e.g. in Zoom, Mentimeter, Ahaslides) with the learners to reactivate the audience and transition to the topic of (Persistent) Identifiers.

Built for human understanding: even though web documents are made with computers, computers can NOT understand the content of these documents. **They can't read, see relationships or make decisions like humans can.**

Most search engines are based on keywords:
<ul>
  <li>results are high recall and low precision</li>
  <li>results are highly sensitive to vocabulary</li>
  <li>results are single human-readable web pages</li>
  <li>**results do not support logical reasoning and query answering**</li>
</ul>

The World Wide Web is a hypermedia system. It contains:

**Resources**
A web resource is any identifiable resource present on or connected to the World Wide Web.
A resource can be anything that has identity.

**Links**
(Web identifiers) between these resources.

## Web Identifiers

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout
## Unique Identifiers

etwas generelles über unique identifiers
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The **Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)** is a string of characters formulated to uniquely identify a resource, (most commonly on the Web) and enable interaction with it via common protocols such as HTTP.

A **Uniform Resource Name (URN)** is a type of URI. It is a standard, persistent and unique identifier for digital resources on the Internet. To link to the resource from the URN, a **resolver service is required.**

The **Uniform Resource Locator (URL)** is a string of characters used to access the information or resource by **using the address of the resource location** via communication protocols such as HTTP.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

A **Persistent Identifier (PID)** is a long-lasting reference to digital objects:
- articles
- datasets
- tables
- figures
- videos
- persons
- instruments
- organizations

**PIDs**[^16]
- are globally unique
- persistent over time
- ensure permanent identifiability, referencing and linking of digital objects
- **make researchers, their affiliations and their contributions more easily discoverable**
- are a key element in [FAIR](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618)

**Frequently used PID schemes**
- Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs)
- Persistent Uniform Resource Locators (PURLs)
- International Standard Book Number (ISBN)
- [<i class='fa fa-external-link-square'></i> ORCIDs](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1825-0097)
- Archival Resource Keys (ARKs)
- International Standard Name Identifier (ISNI) 

### The Semantic Web
**The term “Semantic Web” refers to [W3C’s](https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/) vision of a Web of Linked Data.**

It provides a way for machines to be able to process and understand the data that they were only to display on the traditional Web. It is a vision for the future Web (a web of meaning — semantics); originally defined by Tim Berners-Lee. The Semantic Web is not a separate Web, but an extension of the current one. In the Semantic Web, metadata are invisible as people read the page, but they're clearly visible to computers.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout 
The goal of a Semantic Web is to **make computers perform more of the tedious work involved in finding, sharing and combining information on the Web efficiently.**

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Use `.md` files for episodes when you want static content
- Use `.Rmd` files for episodes when you need to generate output
- Run `sandpaper::check_lesson()` to identify any issues with your lesson
- Run `sandpaper::build_lesson()` to preview your lesson locally
