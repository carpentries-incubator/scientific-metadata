## Lecture: What is data?

**Slide set**: <a href="../files/slideSet/1_WhatIsData_CarpentriesIncubator_ScientificMetadata.pdf" target="_blank" download>WhatIsData.pdf</a>

**Time estimate**: 5 min

1. -
2. What is data? (<i>direct this question to the audience and allow them to just shout in. Wait a little, it might be quiet</i> :wink:)
3. We start with an example: Imagine a satellite transmitting data back to earth.
4. This is what actually arrives at the machine receiving the transmission...
5. just a concatenation of signs...
6. we call these **glyphs**. To a human being, this sequence of glyphs is not understandable and it needs some processing by a machine to make it interpretable for humans. And this is data...
7. a **potentially informative object**. 
8. If the data is now processed by the receiving machine, it will be converted in this picture. (<i>The satellite image shows the city center of Cologne, Germany. Feel free to substitute it with a place your learners are familiar with and activate them by asking "Does anyone know, what is depicted?"</i>) In this processed form, the data becomes human-readable. In information science, this is what we call information.
9. Knowledge is internalized information. For example, knowing where on the image the cathedral is located.
10. The highest level of information content is wisdom, which means putting the acquired knowledge into context, the bigger picture. You might use the satellite image to navigate between two locations, for example. Naturally, as researchers, we strive to reach wisdom with our work.
11. We have seen, that the information content increases by adding context, meaning, and insight to data.
12. The takeaway message is: Data is **potential information** and needs to be processed and **contextualized** to make it accessible for the human audience.

## Lecture: The example data object

**Slide set**: <a href="../files/slideSet/2_TheExampleDataObject_CarpentriesIncubator_ScientificMetadata.pdf" target="_blank" download>TheExampleDataObject.pdf</a>

**Time estimate**: 5 min

1. Now back to the example data you received from us. (<i>Here you can reflect on some of the statements made during the introduction session.</i>) What is actually represented in the data is this...
2. (<i>Empty slide: open <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeKIBSN2F5c" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeKIBSN2F5c</a> in a new tab or window and play the video. We start the video from 0:30. </i>)
3. Shown in the data is the ride time (t)...
4. the biomechanical acceleration of a human body during the rollercoaster ride in x, y, and z axis... (<i>Yes, the image of the toy bunny is really taken from a peer-reviewed journal publication.</i>)
5. and a boolean value, stating whether a scream of the test person could be detected or not.
6. (<i>Allow some time for questions.</i>)

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The question "What is data?" seems trivial at first, but if we look at
the definition, it is apparent that the question is not that easy to
answer. In information science, we distinguish between Glyphs (or
symbols), data, information, knowledge and wisdom. **GLYPHS** are the
smallest unit of data representation. Glyphs represent the symbols of
which data can be composed.

To cite the information scientist Jeffrey Pomerantz, "**DATA** is stuff.
It is raw, unprocessed, possibly even untouched by human hands, unviewed
by human eyes, un-thought-about by human minds"[^1]. In other words,
data is potential information, that requires processing and context to
extract the information held within.

[^1]: Pomerantz, J. (2015). <i>Metadata</i>. The MIT Press. https://doi.org/10.7551/mitpress/10237.001.0001

Accordingly, **INFORMATION** is processed, human-consumable data. If
this information is internalized by a human being, it is called
**KNOWLEDGE**. This knowledge can be applied in a broader context by the
human being. Applied knowledge is called **WISDOM**. The key to reaching
wisdom from data is processing and contextualizing data to extract
information. To achieve this goal we often need to add a description to
the data: **metadata**.

## Lecture: What is metadata?

**Slide set**: <a href="../files/slideSet/3_WhatIsMetadata_CarpentriesIncubator_ScientificMetadata.pdf" target="_blank" download>WhatIsMetadata.pdf</a>

**Time estimate**: 5 min

1. What is metadata? (<i>Direct this question to the learners and wait for them to reply. They might come up with the generic "Data about data".</i>)
2. Often metadata is described as "data about data", or - as Merriam Webster puts it - "metadata is data that provides information about other data". But this is extremely unspecific.
3. If you look a bit further, you can find more detailed description of the term "metadata". Admittedly, these texts are seldomly...
4. fun to read.
5. Let's start - again - with an example. Let's say, you are looking for an informative book about the topic of metadata and decide to look for recommendations online...
6. your search will result in about 1.5 million results. But you remember a colleague, that has recently mentioned a very good book on metadata...
7. you ask him about it, and he gives you a well-meaning description of said book - "It is black, and the title is 'metadata'. It was written by Jeff... Jeff... Something."
8. Okay, this is not really precise, but you take this information to your favorite search engine, and it will most likely come back with this ...
9. book: "Metadata" by Jeffrey Pomerantz, published in the MIT Press Essential Knowledge series. So far, you have absolutely no idea about the content of the book - the actual data it contains. However, with just a few clues on the title, author, and design, you can identify the resource. You did this by using "metadata". Let's stay with this example for a bit and take a look inside...

## Lecture: Descriptive, administrative, structural metadata

**Slide set**: <a href="../files/slideSet/4_DescriptiveAdministrativeStructuralMetadata_CarpentriesIncubator_ScientificMetadata.pdf" target="_blank" download>DescriptiveAdministrativeStructuralMetadata.pdf</a>

**Time estimate**: 5 min

1. On one of the first pages, you will find a lot of information about the book...
2. You will get information about the author, publisher, relevant keywords and so on, that are descriptive in nature and can help you - or librarians - to successfully identify this specific book. Among these there is a very important descriptor...
3. The persistent identifier. In the example of a book, this is the ISBN. Whenever you look up this number, the result will unambiguously point to this specific title.
4. Furthermore, you will get information about how the book is administered: How it is distributed, who is responsible for its distribution and which conditions need to apply.
5. You can also find information on legal conditions that apply to this resource, such as copyright issues and the terms of distribution. Legal information can be considered as a subset of administrative information.
6. And - really important - you will get a precise idea about the book's structure and how you can navigate it: the chapters, its general content and how it is distributed over the pages. But still: we have not yet read a single word, that actually delivers the content of the book - its data.
7. So, metadata - or metainformation - is more or less structured data, that contains information about characteristics of other data (objects).
8. Let's briefly reflect on the types of metadata, that we came across so far, before we apply these concepts in the first challenge for today: 
  - *descriptive metadata* holds information about the intellectual content, such as title, author, abstract...
  - *administrative metadata* specifies how a resource is managed. This includes things such as the terms of (re-)distribution and copyright information. This also includes technical information about the data (such as files included in a dataset) or versioning information...
  - *structural metadata* describe, for example, chapters in a book, files in a dataset, or software components.
9. (<i>Allow some time for questions.</i>)

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Metadata is **(semi-)structured data** that provides information about
characteristics of other (more complex) data objects (e.g. files or
documents). Regarding research data, metadata gives the observer the
necessary context to interpret the data and derive information from it.
Although metadata is data itself, it only is meaningful in connection with a
data object that is described by the metadata record (e.g. the
meta-information in a book about said book). Metadata can be found
inside of a data object (e.g. in a book, in a data record) or as a
separate object (e.g. library catalogue, separate file).

<a href="https://groups.niso.org/higherlogic/ws/public/download/17446/Understanding%20Metadata.pdf" target="_blank">National Information Standards
Organization</a>
(NISO, 2004, from "Big Data, Little Data, No Data", Christine L.
Borgman, 2015): "*Metadata is structured information that describes,
explains, locates, or otherwise makes it easier to retrieve, use or
manage an information resource*".

## Types of Metadata

**Descriptive metadata** provides information about the intellectual
content of a (digital) object (e.g. title, author, date of publication,
subject, description, unique identifier). [^2]

[^2]: Zhang, A. B., Gourley, D. (2008). <i>Metadata strategy</i> in Creating Digital Collections: a practical Guide. Sawston, UK: Woodhead Publishing.

**Administrative metadata** provides information to support the
management of a resource (e.g. technical information regarding the
file's creation and format, version, information about copyright,
licence and intellectual property rights). [<sup>2</sup>](#fn2)

**Structural metadata** specifies the relationships between components
of a (digital) object and between different (digital) objects (e.g.
chapters in a book). [<sup>2</sup>](#fn2)

## Challenge 1: Real-world Metadata

**Slide set**: <a href="../files/slideSet/5_Challenge1RealWorldMetadata_CarpentriesIncubator_ScientificMetadata.pdf" target="_blank" download>Challenge1RealWorldMetadata.pdf</a>

**Time:** 15 min 

**Challenge type:** guided confrontation, individual investigation, discussion

**Objective:** <br>
The learners experience a real-world example of functional metadata applications and practice their acquired knowledge on metadata types.

**Implementation:** <br>
We recommend using a pre-structured, collaborative document 
(whiteboard or notepad) to collect the participants' results.
Allow some time for the learners to navigate the websites and explore the metadata in the source code individually (ca. 8 min). Open the source code of one website in the browser and share the screen. Talking points for the guided confrontation can be: 
<ul>
  <li>different types of targets (e.g. `twitter:`, `robots:`)</li>
  <li>different contexts (e.g. `dc:`, `og:`); don't go too deep into this topic, and just give a teaser about the existence of metadata standards and references</li>
  <li>**Fun fact:** *The Guardian* regularly uses a comment in the `head` of their HTML documents to advertise IT jobs :grin: </li>

## Lecture: Metadata in the scientific context

**Slide set**: <a href="../files/slideSet/6_MetadataInScience_CarpentriesIncubator_ScientificMetadata.pdf" target="_blank" download>MetadataInScience.pdf</a>

**Time estimate**: 10 min

1. Now let's shift our focus to metadata annotation in the scientific context.
2. I'm sure many of us have been in a similar situation. You start a new project that is based on the work of your predecessor or collaborators and you are supposed to start with reproducing the published results...
3. You take a look at the accompanying publication and the data looks neat...
4. But as soon as you open the underlying datasets, understanding the process of how this data was acquired is not so straightforward anymore. The variables might be hard to understand, there might be missing values, and the performed data cleaning is not necessarily apparent.
5. So you take a look at the experiment's documentation...
6. A study by Monya Baker, which was published in Nature in 2016 was able to show, that more than 70% of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist's experiments. And more than half have even failed to reproduce their *own* experiments.
7. The worst practice that you can encounter in your scientific life is surely data, saved under an uninformative file name, with no documentation whatsoever.
8. Slightly better practice are lab notes, which are still widely used as the go-to documentation method in experimental scientific areas. Using lab notes as documentation method, you can facilitate the findability... 
9. by assigning meaningful file names and dates to your data. However...
10. lab notes come with various disadvantages. Lab notes are usually taken continuously and over the course of a 3-year contract, several hundred pages of lab notes can accumulate.
11. so even though lab notes allow for some kind of documentation, they are largely unstructured and subjective, rarely following templates or guidelines. Continuously taking notes makes the documentation hard to retrieve. The notes are physically separated from the data they describe and remain in the hand of the experimenter or institution hosting the experiments, which makes them hard to share. And let's admit it - handwriting can be a *pain* to read.
12. One way to store your documentation with your data, is README-style metadata... 
13. Just like taking lab notes, README-style files can be simple, subjectively written natural text documents. 
14. You can also find templates for README-style metadata records. Sticking to these templates will allow for increased structure in your documentation records. Now that we document our data digitally, we have increased options to link the metadata to the described dataset, for example by naming them accordingly...
15. If you now want to find the results of a specific experiment on your computer, a local keyword search can help you to identify the dataset.
16. To sum up, digital documentation of your metadata in form of README-style metadata records, facilitates the linkage of data and metadata, allows for local searchability and increased readability, and the digital nature of the README file simplifies targeted sharing of the documentation. However, these records are still rather unstructured and subjective, and only allow for keyword searches.
17. If you want to have a look at a well-designed template for README-style metadata records, a recommended link is provided in the episode description.
18. (<i>Allow some time for questions.</i>)

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

**Handwritten (lab) notes** Handwritten (lab) notes are still a common
practice in many scientific disciplines. These notes are easy to take
during data generation. The greatest disadvantage, however, is the
physical separation from the data itself and the difficulty to find,
store and share this information. Often, handwritten lab notes do not
follow a predictable structure and, hence, are hard to interpret and
sometimes even hard to read.

**Readme style text documents** Recording your metadata (additionally)
in a digital `README`-style text document comes with one great advantage:
the metadata can be associated and stored directly with the experimental
data. `README`-style metadata best practices include:[^5]

[^5]: Chadwick, I. (2016). <i>Research Data Management: guide to writing ”readme” type metadata.</i> The Open University. https://www.open.ac.uk/library-research-support/sites/www.open.ac.uk.library-research-support/files/files/RDM-Guidelines-for-creating-readme-style-metadata.pdf

<ul>

<li>creating one `README` file for each data file, whenever possible.</li>

<li>naming the `README` in a way that it is easily associated with the
data file(s) it describes.</li>

<li>writing the `README` document as a plain text file for
interoperability.</li>

<li>formatting multiple `README` files identically.</li>

<li>where possible follow established conventions for scientific
vocabulary (i.e. from glossaries or resources such as the <a href="https://goldbook.iupac.org/" target="_blank">IUPAC Gold
book</a>)</li>

</ul>

We strongly recommend to use <a href="https://cornell.app.box.com/v/ReadmeTemplate" target="_blank">**this template**</a> for readme style metadata documents.

# Guided confrontation: Metadata in scientific publications

**Slide set:** -

**Time:** 15 min

**Type:** guided confrontation, collaboration

**Objective:** <br>
The learners apply their acquired knowledge about metadata identification and types in the context of a familiar work situation.

**Implementation:** <br>
<ul>
  <li>select a scientific journal publication of your liking (could be related to the research field of the learners, if the group is homogeneous in this regard.)</li>
  <li>share the publication on your screen</li>
  <li>with the whole group of learners, find the "hidden" metadata in the publication and sort the findings into the metadata types (descriptive, administrative, structural)</li>
</ul>

**Creator's recommendation**: <br>
Use a whiteboard application to display the journal publication. This allows for simultaneous highlighting / annotation of the findings and thus gives a visual response and documentation of the discussion.

-   **Data** is potential information.
-   Borders between **data** and **metadata** are fluid and depend on
    the context.
-   **Scientific meta information** is often recorded in handwritten
    (lab) notes. A better - though still limited - solution, is the documentation of scientific metadata in accompanying `README` files
