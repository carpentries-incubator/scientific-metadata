This README describes the data in trainingDataObject.csv

The data describes the biomechanical acceleration and screams detected of a test person during the ride of the roller coaster “Flight of the Bat” in Gotham City.

The data was collected by Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle (Institute for Vigilance and Nightly Motion - Justice League) on 2022-02-28 in Gotham City, New Jersey.

The test person (male) is 5’11 tall and weighs 187 lbs.

The test person strapped the recording device (iPhone X) with a running armband to the left upper arm and activated the biomechanical acceleration and scream detection of the application “Physics Toolbox Suite” by Vieyra Software.

- “t” describes the ride time at which measurements were taken upon activating the recording in seconds.
- “ax” describes the biomechanical acceleration of the test person on the x axis in m/s².
- “ay” describes the biomechanical acceleration of the test person on the y axis in m/s².
- “az” describes the biomechanical acceleration of the test person on the z axis in m/s².
- “scr” is a boolean indicating a detected scream of the test person.
