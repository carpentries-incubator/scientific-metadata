<h4 style="display:flex">Robert Medina</h4>
Robert earned his PhD in Biochemistry and currently holds a postdoc position in a biotechnology lab. In his research he conducts multiple proteomic studies, resulting in large amounts of data. <br>
While writing his PhD thesis, Robert got frustrated about his own experiment documentation and realized how hard it is to remember details and protocols of experiments that date back three years and longer. Hence, he decided to change his documentation and data annotation habits.<br>
Robert analyzes his data in MS Excel and basic R-scripts and has never heard about XML, YAML or JSON.</span>

<h4 style="display:flex">Linda Sievers</h4>
Linda is a mechanical engineer who recently joined the research data management (RDM) department of a large research institute as a data steward. Previously, she gained several years of experience in R&D and consulting in academia as well as a corporate context.<br>
Fairly new to the topic, Linda currently works her way through literature on RDM. She is familiar with the FAIR principles on a theoretical level but wants to gain more experience on the application level. Additionally, Linda is keen on getting to know helpful tools and resources for research metadata handling, which could make her, her colleagues', and her stakeholder's work life easier. </span>
