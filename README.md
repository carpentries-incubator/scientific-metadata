# Fundamentals of Scientific Metadata: Why Context Matters

This course is an entry-level introduction to the fundamentals of scientific metadata for PhD students, early-career researchers and Postdocs. In this course we will look at the intricate relationship between (digital) research data, metadata and knowledge, discuss why metadata is critical in today’s research, as well as explain some of the technologies and concepts related to structured machine-readable metadata.
