### Welcome,
<br>
to our entry-level introduction to the **fundamentals of scientific metadata**!

In this lesson we will look at the intricate relationship between (digital) research data, metadata and knowledge, discuss why metadata is critical in todays research, as well as explain some of the technologies and concepts related to structured machine-readible metadata.

Have you ever struggled to make sense of scientific data provided by a collaborator - or even understanding your own data 5 months after publication? Do you see difficulties in meeting the data description requirements of your funding agency? Do you want your data to have lasting value, but donâ€™t know how to ensure that?

Precise and structured description of research data is key for scientific exchange and progress - and also for the recognition of your effort in data collection. The solution: make your data findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable by describing them with metadata.

This course is targeted at scientific staff and researchers from all fields, who would like to better understand research data annotation with metadata.<br><br>

**You will learn...**
<ul style="list-style:none">
  <li>... of the difference between and the importance of data & metadata</li>
  <li>... how to annotate your research data with structured metadata</li>
  <li>... how to find and evaluate a suitable metadata framework and data repository</li>
  <li>... how to use basic Markdown / JSON / JSON Schema</li>
  <li>... about available tools that you can use to up your metadata annotation game</li>
  <li>... why structured metadata is important and how it can increase your scientific visibility</li>
</ul><br>
