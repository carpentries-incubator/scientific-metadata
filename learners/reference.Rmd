## Glossary

Metadata
: Any data which is intended to help contextualize or otherwise qualify other data. Examples include file size, date created, method used to generate the data and identifiers for people who worked on the data. [^first]

Metadata schema
: A template which shows how metadata is to be structured and stored. [<sup>1</sup>](#fn1)

Metadata standard
: A metadata schema that is well-established, accepted and widely used (in a community).

JSON
: JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is an open standard file format and data interchange  format that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data objects. JSON consists  of attributeâ€“value pairs and is language-independent. Many modern programming languages  include code to generate and parse JSON-format data. JSON filenames use the extension .json.[^second]

PID
: A persistent identifier (PID) is a long-lasting reference to an object. Some persistent identifiers are linked to kernel information profiles which provide metadata or information about that object when the persistent identifier is resolved. [<sup>1</sup>](#fn1)

URI
: The Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a string of characters formulated to uniquely identify a resource, (most commonly on the Web) and enable interaction with it via common protocols such as HTTP.

URL
: The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is a string of characters used to access the information or resource by using the address of the resource location via communication protocols such as HTTP. 

URN
: A Uniform Resource Name (URN) is a type of URI. It is a standard, persistent and unique identifier for digital resources on the Internet. To link to the resource from the URN, a resolver service is required.

Web resource
: A web resource can be any entity - digityl, physical or abstract - that is represented on the Web. Data elements are wrapped in start and end tags. XML tags can be customized by the author of the document, its markup is therefore not limited to a set of rules but extensible.

XML
: XML (Extensible Markup Language) is an open standard file format and data interchange  format that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data objects.
