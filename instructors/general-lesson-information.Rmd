thank you for your interest in our training course **"Fundamentals of scientific metadata"**. 

On this page, we would like to give you a brief overview on the course material. Detailed teaching instructions can be found in the <a href="instructor-guide.html" target="_blank">Instructor guide</a>.

This lesson was designed to be taught on two consecutive days, spanning 4 hours a day.
A detailed schedule is included in the Instructor guide.

<br>

### Instructor guide
In the instructor guide, we will provide you with all the detailed information on lesson structure and schedule, additional content, and recommendations necessary to teach this lesson. 

Also included in the Instructor guide, you can find `Talking points` for lectures, challenges, live coding and other content. Lecture talking points contain download links for the accompanying slide sets. Of course you are free to use your own slides and take our talking points as a guide line. All of these `Talking points` can also be found in the instructor notes of the individual episodes.

**Talking points examples:**
(<i>Additional information for instructors are written in italics</i>)

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor
## Lecture: This is a talking points example for a lecture

**Slide set**: LINK (<i>Download link to lecture slide set</i>)

**Time estimate**: XX min. (<i>approx. time needed to deliver this content<i>)

**Talking points**:
- In lecture talking points each bullet refers to one slide in the provided slide set 
- So this point would be referring to slide 2.
- If a bullet ends with `...` ...
- several slides are used to bring across the statement ...
- in this case, ending with slide 5.

## Challenge: Structure of challenge notes

**Time:** 15 min (<i>time assigned for this challenge</i>)

**Challenge type:** guided confrontation, individual investigation, discussion

**Objective:** <br>
Objective of the challenge. What do we want to achieve here.

**Implementation:** <br>
Detailed information and talking points to guide instructors and learners through the challenge

**Material:** <br>
specifying additional material needed for this challenge, including downloads and example setups.

### Group challenges and handouts
The **challenges 2 - 4** are designed as **group work challenges**. Challenge 5 can be tackled in a group or individually. We recommend group sizes of 4 - 6 learners that work together in breakout rooms and one instructor or teaching support per group. 
For these challenges, we prepare handouts for each group in Markdown-based shared documents (e.g. [HedgeDoc](https://hedgedoc.org/)). These handouts allow for immediate and collaborative work on the challenges. Pre-defined code blocks can be used to collect and discuss the results.

**Group handout Markdown:** <a href="../files/exampleGroupHandout.txt" target="_blank">exampleGroupHandout.md</a> (optimised for HedgeDoc) <br>

### Example Data
The lesson starts by introducing a barely annotated data set, which operates as the base of the whole lesson. Throughout the episodes, the learners will gradually be supplied with more information about this data set, annotate it with the given information and continuously improve the accompanying metadata to achieve its findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability.

This lesson was designed for a research area heterogenous group of learners. Hence we decided to use a data set, that is unlikely to appear in the scientific context, yet has the possibility to be applied as such.<br>
The attached data set holds information on the biomechanical acceleration of a human body experienced througout the ride of the roller coaster "Colossus" at Thorpe Park, Surrey, England ([https://apparentlysew.weebly.com/stem-blog/using-accelerometers-on-roller-coasters-thorpe-park](https://apparentlysew.weebly.com/stem-blog/using-accelerometers-on-roller-coasters-thorpe-park){target="_blank"}). 

We added variable names, transformed the time values and mocked the "scream detected" variable with boolean values based on [this onride video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeKIBSN2F5c){target="_blank"}.

**Example data set:** <a href="../files/exampleDataObject.csv"> exampleDataObject.csv</a>

<a href="../files/exampleDataObjectColor.png" target="popup" onclick="window.open('../docs/files/exampleDataObjectColor.png,'popup','width=1200'); return false;" onMouseOver="document.exampleData.src='../../docs/files/CLICKexampleDataObjectColor.png';" onMouseOut="document.exampleData.src='../../docs/files/exampleDataObjectColor.png';"><span><img src="files/exampleDataObjectColor.png" alt="Screenshot of example data object." name="exampleData"/></span></a>

<br>

### Learning Objectives
Our learning objectives follow the model of <a href="https://archive.org/details/taxonomyofeducat0000bloo_o9o7" target="_blank">Bloom <i>et al.</i> (1956)</a> and use the measurable verbs proposed by <a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/educsci6040037" target="_blank">Stanny <i>et al.</i> (2016)</a>.

<br>

### Episode 0: Housekeeping
In the Instructor guide, we included sections labelled "Episode 0: Housekeeping". These sections are not directly related with the lesson subject but are important (to us) for the overall teaching experience. Episode 0 sections include activities like learner warm-ups and feedback and can be found in the detailed lesson schedule.

<br>

### Lightning Talk
We made very good experiences with closing the lesson with a **lightning talk**, that focusses on the application of structured metadata in research, gives an insight into data annotation with metadata in practice, or demonstrates a recent (scientific) software development in the metadata field. For this section, we usually invite an external speaker and assign **45 min** including discussions to the schedule of day 2. 
In our 2 day approach, we end at lunch time on the second day, which allows for extra time for discussions with the speaker. The lightning talk so far got gread feedback from the learners.
