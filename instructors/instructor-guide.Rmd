**Description:**<br>
The learners get an introduction into data and metadata in everyday life and research contexts. Descriptive, administrative, and structural metadata are distinguished. The learners conduct a guided online search (URLs are provided) and explore the metadata tagging in selected web pages. Good (enough) and worst practices of metadata annotation will be covered in the fina talk of this module. The presentation is complemented with a live demonstration, collaboratively extracting metadata from scientific publications.  

**Talking Points:**

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor
## Lecture: What is data?

**Slide set**: 3 - 14<br>
**Time estimate**:

- What is data? (<i>direct this question to the audience and allow them to just shout in. Wait a little, it might be quiet</i> :wink:)
- We start with an example: Imagine a satellite transmitting data back to earth.
- This is what actually arrives at the machine receiving the transmission...
- just a concatenation of signs...
- we call these **glyphs**. To a human being, this sequence of glyphs is not understandable and it needs some processing by a machine to make it interpretable for humans. And this is data...
- a **potentially informative object**. 
- If the data is now processed by the receiving machine, it will be converted in this picture. (<i>The satellite image shows the city center of Cologne, Germany. Feel free to substitute it with a place your learners are familiar with and activate them by asking "Does anyone know, what is depicted?"</i>) In this processed form, the data becomes human-readable. In information science, this is what we call information.
- Knowledge is intrinsified information. For example, knowing where on the image the cathedral is located.
- The highest level of information content is wisdom, which means putting the acquired knowledge into context, the bigger picture. You might use the satellite image to navigate between to locations, for example. Naturally, as researchers, we strive to reach wisdom with our work.
- We have seen, that the information content increases by adding context, meaning, and insight to data.
-The take-away message is: Data is **potential information** and needs to be processed and contextualized** to make it accessible for the human audience.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor
## Lecture: The example data object

**Slide set**: 15 - 19<br>
**Time estimate**:

- Now back to the example data you received from us. (<i>Here you can reflect on some of the statements made during the introduction session.</i>) What actually is represented in the data is this...
- (<i>Empty slide: open <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeKIBSN2F5c" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeKIBSN2F5c</a> in a new tab or window and play the video. We start the video from 0:30. </i>)
- Shown in the data is the ride time (t)...
- the biomechanical acceleration of a human body during the rollercoaster ride in x, y, and z axis... (<i>Yes, the image of the toy bunny is really taken from a peer reviewed journal publication.</i>)
- and a boolean value, stating whether a scream of the test person could be detected or not.
- (<i>allow some time for questions</i>)

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor
## Lecture: What is metadata?

**Slide set**: 20 - 28<br>
**Time estimate**:

- What is metadata? (<i>Direct this questions to the learners and wait for them to reply. They might come up with the generic "Data about data".</i>)
- Often metadata is described as "data about data", or - as Merriam Webster puts it - "metadata is data that provides information about other data". But this is extremely unspecific.
- If you look a bit further, you can find more detailed description of the term "metadata". Admittedly, these text are seldomly...
- fun to read.
- Let's start - again - with an example. Let's say, you are looking for an informative book about the topic of metadata and decide to look for recommendations online...
- your search will result in about 1,5 million results. But you remember a colleague, that has recently talked about a very good book on metadata...
- you ask him about it and he gives you a well-meaning description of said book. "It is black and the title is 'metadata'. It was written by Jeff... Jeff... Something."
- Okay, this is not really precise but you take these information to your favourite search engine and you will most likely come up with this ...
- book. Metadata by Jeffrey Pomerantz published in the MIT Press Essential Knowledge series. So far, you have absolutely no idea about the content of the book - the actually data that is hold by it. However, with just a few clues on the title, author, and design, you can identify the ressource. You did this by using "metadata". Let's stay with this example for a bit and take a look inside... 

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor
## Lecture: Descriptive, administrative, structural metadata

**Slide set**: 29 - 37<br>
**Time estimate**:

- On one of first pages, you will find a lot of information about the book...
- You will get information on author, publisher, keywords and so on, that are descriptive in nature and can help you - or librarians - to successfully identify this specific book. Among these is a very important descriptor...
- The persistent identifier. In the example of a book, this is the ISBN number. Whenever you look up this number, the result will unambiguously point to this specific title.
- Furthermore, you will get information about how the book is administered: How it is distributed, who is responsible for its distribution and which conditions need to apply.
- You can also find information on legal conditions that apply to this resource, such as copyright issues and the terms of distribution. Legal information can be considered as a subset of administrative information.
- And - really important - you will get a precise idea about the book's structure and how you can navigate it: the chapters, its general content and how it is distributed over the pages. But still: we have not yet read a single word, that actually delivers the content of the book - its data.
- So, metadata - or metainformation - is more or less structured data, that contains information about characteristics of other data (objects).
- Let's briefly reflect on the types of metadata, that we came across so far, before we apply these concepts in the first challenge for today: 
  - descriptive metadata holds information about the intellectual content, such as title, author, abstract...
  - administrative metadata specifies how a resource is managed. This can be terms of distribution and copyright information. Regarding published data, this also applies to technical information on the files included in a data set or versioning...
  - structural metadata describe, for example chapters in a book, file in a data set, or software components.

## Challenge 2: Real world metadata

**Slide set**: 38

**Time:** 15 min 

**Challenge type:** guided confrontation, individual investigation, discussion

**Objective:** <br>
The learners experience a real world example of functional metadata applications and practice their acquired knowledge on metadata types.

**Implementation:** <br>
We recommend using a pre-structured, collaborative document 
(whiteboard or notepad) to collect the participants' results.
Allow for some time for the learners to navigate the websites and explore the metadata in the source code individually (ca. 8 min). Open the source code of one website in the browser and share the screen. Talking points for the guided confrontation can be: 
<ul>
  <li>different types of targets (e.g. `twitter:`, `robots:`)</li>
  <li>different contexts (e.g. `dc:`, `og:`); don't go to deep in this topic and just teaser the existence of metadata standards and references</li>
  <li>**Fun fact:** *The Guardian* regularly uses a comment in the `head` of their html documents to advertise IT jobs :grin: </li>
</ul>

**White board:** <a href="../../../episodes/files/exampleChallenge1Whiteboard.pdf">example set-up</a>

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor
## Lecture: Metadata in the scientific context

**Slide set**: 39 - 56<br>
**Time estimate**: 10 min

- Now let's shift our focus on metadata annotation in the scientific context.
- I'm sure many of us have been in a similar situation. You start a new project that is based on the work of your predecessor or collaborators and you are supposed to start with reproducing the published results...
- You take a look at the accompnying publication and the data looks neat...
- But as soon as you open the underlying data sets, understanding the process on how this data was acquired is not so straight forward anymore. The variables might be hard to understand, there might be missing values, and the data cleaning is not necessarily apparent.
- So you take a look at the experiment's documentation...
- A study by Monya Baker, that was published in Nature in 2016 was able to show, that more than 70% of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientis's experiments. And more than half have even failed to reproduce their own experiments.
- The worst practice that you can encounter in your scientific life is surely data, saved under an inexplicit file name with no documentation whatsoever.
- Slightly better practice are lab notes, which are still widely used as the go-to documentation method in experimental scientific areas. Using lab notes as documentation method, you can facilitate the findability by assigning meaningful file names to your data. However...
- lab notes come with various disadvantages. Lab notes are usually taken continuously and over the course of a 3-year contract, several hundred pages of lab notes can accumulate.
- so even though lab notes allow for some kind of documentation, they are largely unstructured and subjective, rarely following templates or guidelines. The continous note taking makes the documentation hard to retrieve. They are physically seperated from the data they describe and remain in the hand of the experimentator or institution hosting the experiments, which makes them hard to share. And let's admit it, handwriting can be a pain to read.
- One way to store your documentation with your data, is README-style metadata. 
- Just like taking lab notes, Readme-style files can be subjectively written natural text documents. 
- You can also find templates for Readme-style metadata records. Sticking to these templates will allow for increased structure in your documentation records. Now that we document our data digitally, we have increased options to link the metadata record to the described data set, for example by naming them accordingly...
- if you now want to find the results of a specific experiment on your computer, a local keyword search can help you to identify the data set.
- To sum up, digital documentation of your metadata in form of Readme-style metadata records, facilitates the linkage of data and metadata, allows for local searchability and increased readability, and the digital nature of the Readme file simplifies targeted sharing of the documentation. However, these records are still rather unstructured and subjective, and only allow for keyword searches.
- If you want to have a look on a well-designed template for Readme-style metadata records, a recommended link is provided in the Episode description.

# Guided confrontation: Metadata in scientific publications

**Slide set:** 57

**Time:** 10 min

**Type:** guided confrontation, collaboration

**Objective:** <br>
The learners apply their acquired knowledge about metadata identification and types on a familiar work situation.

**Implementation:** <br>
<ul>
  <li>select a scientific journal publication of your liking (could be related to the research field of the learners, if the group is homogeneous in this regard.)</li>
  <li>share the journal on your screen</li>
  <li>with the whole group of learners, find the "hidden" metadata in the publication and sort the findings into the metadata types (descriptive, administrative, structural)</li>
</ul>

**Creator's recommendation**: <br>
Use a white board application to display the journal publication. This allows for simultaneous highlighting / annotation of the findings and thus gives a visual response and documentation of the discussion.

**Description:**<br>
This episode introduces the concept of semi-structured metadata in regards to machine accessibility and interoperability. After defining the term "Markup", the learners will be confronted with XML and JSON as data exchance formats. In the challenges 2 & 3, the learners will apply the lecture content to the example data object by extracting metadata from an accompanying Readme file and annotating the example data object in a JSON object literal. Challenges will be tackled in groups of 5 - 7 learners. Group results are compared and discussed in a plenary discussion. Ideally, the learners will experience light frustration during result comparison, realizing, that structuring their metadata will result in valid machine interpretable data objects, yet lack of comparability and reusability.

**Talking Points:**

## Lecture: Introduction to information transfer

**Slide set**: 59 - 62<br>
**Time estimate**: 5 min

- With the next episode, we are diving deaper into the topic of structured data and enhancing machine readability of our metadata records.
- So far we have been talking about natural language communication. When the senior doctor gives a status update about a patient's condition to his colleague, the information is clear. Let's take this message apart and structure it...
- The message is concering a subject, namely the specific patient in room 305. It includes a location, the room number and it gives information about the current condition, unchanged. Let's assume that both doctors were machines. Extracting these information from the natural language text wouldn't be as straight forward...
- And the information needs to be structured in particular ways to make it easily transferrable and accessible for the receiving end. One such leightweight data structure is JSON, JavaScript Object Notation. We will take an in depth look at JSON in the upcoming lectures.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor
## Lecture: What is Markup, XML & JSON

**Slide set**: <br>
**Time estimate**: 15

- The first term, that we will come across regularly throughout this lesson is Markup.
- You encounter markup continuously, when you read a text. A period, for example, indicates the end of a declarative or imperative sentence, which results in the speaker briefly stopping to talk, when read out loud. The question mark, on the other hand, declares a question and a speaker will raise their voice before pausing. In this sense, the punctuation - or Markup - is not part of the text or information by itself. It rather give some additional information about the text.
- Essential for functional markup is that the sender - in case of a text the writer - and the recipient - the reader - agree on the interpretation of the symbols used to markup the text. Shown here is an interrobang, a combination of questionmark and exclamation point. (<i>You can reactivate the audience by asking them, whether someone is familiar with the definition of the interrobang or if they would know how to interprete it.</i>) The interrobang was proposed in the 1960s as a new punctuation mark to indicate a rhetorical question. As you might have guessed already, the proposal did not come very far.
- Markup can be distinguished into four different types:
  - punctuational markup, as seen in the previous examples.
  - presentational markup gives information on how the text should be displayed, which includes vertical or horizontal spacing, page breaks, and enumerations of lists. When enclosing text between two asterisks while writing Markdown, a Markdown interpreter will display this text in bold font face.
  - descriptive or declarative markup gives information on the type or class the enclosed text belongs to. In this example, the text was enclosed by an H1 opening and closing tag. HTML interpreters will now know, that this sentence is the most important headline on the page, regardless of how it is displayed.
  - referential markup refers to entities external to the document. On ta website, this marked up sentence would appear as a link and redirect the user to the specified URL, when activated.
- I'm certain all of us have manually marked up a document in one way or another, using a text marker while reading a journal publication or commenting a manuscript while reviewing it. These markups give information to the human reader: What is important in this text? Whis information are missing? Markup in computer files, however, is targetting a machine for interpretation. It declares how the content should be formatted or printed, or give additional information on the written words.
- So from now on in this lecture, the term markup will refer to markup that targets computers, mainly descriptive and referential markup.
- Descriptive and referential markup, used rigorously, is a way to make data and natural text more accessible for computer analysis and can provide additional information for the human user as well. But we will come to that in a bit.
- We will first shift our focus on the importance of the interoperability of the data formats that we want to use to document our data and metadata. In the 1980s, roughly 10 years before the birth of the world wide web, the internet was already a thing and national and international data networks were emerging fast. This increased the need for standardized data transfer formats to facilitate the data exchange and interpretability on various machines in one networt. One of the first insdustry standards for electronic publishing was the Standard Generalized **Markup** Language or SGML.
- With the implementation of the World Wide Web, HTML - the HyperText **Markup** Language - became the standard language for web pages and has its roots in SGML. The markup tags of HTML and their interpretation are well-defined.  XML - the eXtensible **Markup** Language - on the other hand, was developed to transfer and store data on the World Wide Web. The tags are arbitrary, descriptive and can be defined by the user. Let's take a closer look.
- This XML example stores data in form of natural text (<i>point to the two sentences</i>) and a number (<i>highlight the "1"</i>). Each of these data elements is enclosed in a start and end end tag. As mentioned before, these tags can be defined arbitrarily, so we state, that the first sentence is the title, the second sentence is a description and the number one represents a word count. We can now introduce a data hierarchy, declaring that all these data elements describe one example. We could now look for the "title" of the "example" and retrieve the data stored between those tags. XML is software- and hardware-independent and still widely used as a data exchange format. Though XML is human-readable, enclosing the data between start and end tags is quite an effort and meddles with the clarity of this format. So we are leaving the realm of markup languages...
- to introduce another data exchange format, which is recommended as a standard from the W3 consortium: JSON. JSON is short for JavaScript Object notation. It is inspired by the JavaScript representation for data objects and bears all the advantages XML has shown - like lightweight data exchange, software- and hardware-independency, and hierarchical structure - with an increased human-readability. For the remainder of this lesson, we will learn how to read, write and standardize JSON object literals.

## Lecture: JSON step-by-step

**Slide set**: <br>
**Time estimate**:

- Let's have a closer look on the structure and syntax of JSON object literals. In this example we have a JSON object, which describes a person named John.
- Objects are enclosed in curly braces.
- Within these objects, data entities are stored in key-value-pairs.
- Keys are always of the data type "string."
- Data values can be given as strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects, or null.
- Don't worry, if not all of these terms ring a bell. We will go through them step by step.
- String values can contain any kind of characters and are characteristically enclosed in parentheses. Each string, no matter how long it is, will be interpreted as a single value.
- Numbers...
- can be either integers or floats.
- Boolean values in JSON...
- has one of two possible values. It is either true or false, or 1 for true and 0 for false, respectively.
- Assigning the data type NULL does not mean the same as zero but rather that no value was assigned to this variable. You might be familiar with other representations, such as NA or nan. If you read a JSON object into Python, for example, NULL will be parsed as nan.
- Values in JSON can also be arrays. For example, John has two parents, Anna and Michael.
- An array is a collection of multiple elements and can be understood as a list of values. The data elements within an array can have the same data type or vary in their data types.
- Last but not least, a value can be another object. John has a pet and the value of the key "pet" is an object describing John's dog Brutus.
- Again, an object contains key-value pairs. These key-value-paris ar seperated by commata and enclosed by curly braces. 
- The seperation of data entities by commata in a JSON object literal is crucial.
- Let's compare the JSON representation of this object with its XML representation...
- Both representations contain the same information. In XML the data value is stored between start and end tags, whereas in JSON, the value is assigned to a property and separated from other entries with a comma. Both representations allow for hierarchical data storage as seen for the description of John's pet. In JSON this is done by nesting objects, in XML the data entries are enclosed by `<pet>` tags. A difference can be seen in the representation for John's parents. Whereas an array is given in the JSON object literal, comparable lists do not exist in XML. Here the parents' names are enclosed individually with the same start and end tag.
- Besides XML and JSON, the third widely used standard data exchange format is YAML. All three formats can be parsed into one another.

## Lecture: Challenge introduction

**Slide set**: <br>
**Time estimate**:

- In the following challenges, we will apply what we have learned in the lectures so far to our example data set. You have inspected the data and realised quite rapidly, that you need more information on the data to make sense of it. So you ask your collaborators for additional meta-information.
- They reply by sending you a README-style metadata file.
- However, your funding agency requires that you upload every data set in your project to their public repository and attach a structured metadata record.
- In challenge 2, you will review the README-style metadata record and highlight all the information that you deem relevant to understand the data and reproduce the experiment.
- In challenge 3, you will then take these information and transform it into a JSON object literal.
- (<i>The challenges are designed as group challenges. We like to add a slide here, on which we list the randomized groups and give additional technical and administrative information.</i>)

The following challenges 2 & 3 will be processed **consecutively in groups of 5 - 6 learners**.

**Total time:** 35 min

**Implementation:** <br>
Prepare shared notes documents for each group of learners attending the lesson. We have good experiences with copying the challenges into the documents and make space for collaborative working on the tasks. <br>
Try to be present with as many instructors as break-out rooms to moderate the discussions and answer questions.

**Shared notes:** <br>
You can find an example Markdown file for the group handouts <a href="../../../episodes/files/exampleGroupHandout.txt" target="_blank">**HERE**</a>. This document is optimized for use in a Hedgedoc document. 

##### <u>Challenge 2: Identify metadata in README.txt</u>

**Time:** 15 min

**Challenge type:** group activity

**Objective:** <br>
The learners practice the acquired knowledge of metadata identification in README style text formats.

##### <u>Challenge 3: Write JSON metadata record</u>

**Time:** 20 min

**Challenge type:** group activity

**Objective:** <br>
The learners create a structured JSON object literal, experience the difficulties in choosing meaningful key strings and value representations.

## Discussion: Challenge reflection

**Time:** 20 min

**Implementation:** <br> 
Display the final JSON object literals of the different groups next to each other. Allow for some time, so that the learners can compare the different results and identify similarities and differences. 

**Objective:** <br>
At this point, the learners should experience some form of frustration - the metadata is now structured and machine readable, yet interoperability and reusability haven't been achieved. This frustration is relieved in the next episode "**Enabling technolgy & Schemas**", when schemas and standards are introduced.

**Leading questions:**<br>
<ul>
  <li>What was easy generating the structured metadata record?</li>
  <li>What was hard? Which points were intensely discussed in the group?</li>
  <li>Which differences do you see between the different JSON metadata records?</li>
  <li>How do you feel after comparing the results?</li>
</ul>

**Creator's recommendation:** <br>
While moderating the discussion, pay attention to and highlight the following characteristics of the created JSON object literals:
<ul>
  <li>(if done correctly) all JSON object literals are **valid**, **functional** and **machine readable**</li>
  <li>representation of key strings (e.g. camel case vs. snake case, capitalization)</li>
  <li>structure of the JSON object literal (e.g. nested objects vs. flat structure)</li>
  <li>value representation</li>
</ul>

**Total time:** 20 min <br>
**Teaching methods:** direct teaching, group activity, discussion <br>
**Learning types:** acquisition, collaboration <br><br>

**Learning Objectives:**<br>
<u>REMEMBER</u><br> 
<ul>
  <li>The learners are familiar with online resources to deepen their knowledge on research (meta)data handling.</li>
  <li>The learners are aware of the content of day 2.</li></ul>

**Description:**<br>
Day 1 concludes with a brief recap on the topics of the first day. Feedback is gathered from the learners and eventually implemented in day 2. An outlook on the contet of the second day is presented.

**Talking Points:**

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor
## Lecture: Reflection Day 1

**Slide set**: <i>not provided in slide set</i><br>
**Time estimate**: 5 min

<i>In this section, the content and topics of the first day are summarized. Use this opportunity to inform / remind the learners of the references / further reading section.</i>

## Lecture: Feedback Day 1

**Slide set**: <i>not provided in slide set</i><br>
**Time estimate**: 10 min

<i>We like to include feedback sessions on each day of the lesson. Of course you are free to skip this part or design it according to your liking. Nevertheless, we want to share our approach, experiences and feedback questions with you </i>:smile:.

**Creators' recommendation:**<br>
In order to increase the response rate and to guarantee that every learner is heard, we dedicate 10 min at the end of each lesson day to an anonymous and instantaneous feedback poll. Our preferred online polling tool is [AHA slides](https://ahaslides.com/). We share the link to the poll with the participants and allow for some time, so that the learners can navigate the feedback poll in their own pace.<br>

<u>QUESTIONS</u><br><br>
1. How do you feel after the first day of scientific metadata?
    - :frowning_face:
    - :confused:
    - :neutral_face:
    - :slightly_smiling_face:
    - :smiley: 
    
2. Please rate the difficulty level of the lecture content.
    - too easy
    - fairly easy
    - just right
    - rather hard
    - too hard

3. Please rate the difficulty level of the hands-on sessions.
    - too easy
    - fairly easy
    - just right
    - rather hard
    - too hard

(<i>After day 1, the questions 2 and 3 usually result in an average between "fairly easy" and "just right", which - for us - is the ideal outcome. The first day is intended to get all the participants, regardless of their scientific background, on the same page and prepare everyone for day 2.</i>)
    
4. I would have liked to learn more about...<br>

(<i>Question 4 is, in our opinion, the most important question of this feedback session. It gives you an insight, which topics might need to be revisited on day 2 and help you to add additional literature recommendation to the references adressing the specific needs of your group of learners. </i>)
