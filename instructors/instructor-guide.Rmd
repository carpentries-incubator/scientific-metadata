## Episode 1: Getting started
This challenge is meant to get the learners into the mindset of the lesson by giving them a (usually) familiar problem: **unsufficiently annotated, uninterpretable data**.

Send this challenge to the learners before the lesson starts. During the warm-up and introduction session of your lesson, ask the learners to briefly share their experiences with the data set. You can use the questions in the overview as a guideline.

We recommend collecting the learners' statements in bullet points on a white board or shared document. After the introduction session, an adhoc summary of the statements can be used to lead over to the lesson topic.

**The subject of the example data will be revealed after the introductory lecture on "What is data?" and bridges over to the topic of metadata.**
