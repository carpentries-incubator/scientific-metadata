<p>This challenge is meant to get the learners into the mindset of the
lesson by giving them a (usually) familiar problem:
<strong>unsufficiently annotated, uninterpretable data</strong>.</p>
<p>Send this challenge to the learners before the lesson starts. During
the warm-up and introduction session of your lesson, ask the learners to
briefly share their impressions with the dataset. You can use the
questions in the overview as a guideline.</p>
<p>We recommend collecting the learnersâ statements in bullet points on
a white board or in a shared document. After the introduction session,
an ad-hoc summary of the statements can be used to lead over to the
lesson topic.</p>
<p><strong>The subject of the example data will be revealed after the
introductory lecture on âWhat is data?â, while bridging over to the
topic of metadata.</strong></p>

<li>What is data? (<em>direct this question to the audience and allow
them to just shout in. Wait a little, it might be quiet</em> <span class="emoji" data-emoji="wink">ð</span>)</li>
<li>We start with an example: Imagine a satellite transmitting data back
to earth.</li>
<li>This is what actually arrives at the machine receiving the
transmissionâ¦</li>
<li>just a concatenation of signsâ¦</li>
<li>we call these <strong>glyphs</strong>. To a human being, this
sequence of glyphs is not understandable and it needs some processing by
a machine to make it interpretable for humans. And this is data, â¦</li>
<li>a <strong>potentially informative object</strong>.</li>
<li>If the data is now processed by the receiving machine, it will be
converted in this picture. (<em>The satellite image shows the city
center of Cologne, Germany. Feel free to substitute it with a place your
learners are familiar with and activate them by asking âDoes anyone
know, what is depicted?â</em>) This processed form allows humans to
interpret and analyze the data to gain information, â¦</li>
<li>for example, identifying the cathedral on the image andâ¦</li>
<li>finding the shortest way from the opera to the cathedral.</li>
<li>Knowledge is internalized information, like navigating through the
streets of Cologne from the opera to the cathedral based on the
satellite image you have seen.</li>
<li>The highest level of information content is wisdom, which means
putting the acquired knowledge into context, the bigger picture. Letâs
say, you have explored Cologneâs city center for a couple of days and
you are approached by a person asking you for the shortest way to the
main station. You show them the way on a map - that is wisdom.
Naturally, as researchers, we strive to reach wisdom with our work.</li>
<li>We have seen, that the information content increases by adding
context, meaning, and insight to data.</li>
<li>The takeaway message is: Data is <strong>potential
information</strong> and needs to be processed and
<strong>contextualized</strong> to make it accessible for the human
audience.</li>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What is metadata? (<em>Direct this question to the learners and wait
for them to reply. They might come up with the generic âData about
dataâ.</em>)</li>
<li>Often metadata is described as âdata about dataâ, or - as Merriam
Webster puts it - âmetadata is data that provides information about
other dataâ. But this is extremely unspecific.</li>
<li>If you look a bit further, you can find more detailed description of
the term âmetadataâ. Admittedly, these texts are seldomlyâ¦</li>
<li>fun to read.</li>
<li>Letâs start - again - with an example. Letâs say, you are looking
for an informative book about the topic of metadata and decide to look
for recommendations onlineâ¦</li>
<li>your search will result in about 1.5 million results. But you
remember a colleague, that has recently mentioned a very good book on
metadataâ¦</li>
<li>you ask him about it, and he gives you a well-meaning description of
said book - âIt is black, and the title is âmetadataâ. It was written by
Jeffâ¦ Jeffâ¦ Something.â</li>
<li>Okay, this is not really precise, but you take this information to
your favorite search engine, and it will most likely come back with this
â¦</li>
<li>book: âMetadataâ by Jeffrey Pomerantz, published in the MIT Press
Essential Knowledge series. So far, you have absolutely no idea about
the content of the book - the actual data it contains. However, with
just a few clues on the title, author, and design, you can identify the
resource. You did this by using âmetadataâ. Letâs stay with this example
for a bit and take a look insideâ¦</li>

keywords and so on, that are descriptive in nature and can help you - or
librarians - to successfully identify this specific book. Among these
there is a very important descriptorâ¦</li>
<li>The persistent identifier. In the example of a book, this is the
ISBN. Whenever you look up this number, the result will unambiguously
point to this specific title.</li>
<li>Furthermore, you will get information about how the book is
administered: How it is distributed, who is responsible for its
distribution and which conditions need to apply.</li>
<li>You can also find information on legal conditions that apply to this
resource, such as copyright issues and the terms of distribution. Legal
information can be considered as a subset of administrative
information.</li>
<li>And - really important - you will get a precise idea about the
bookâs structure and how you can navigate it: the chapters, its general
content and how it is distributed over the pages. But still: we have not
yet read a single word, that actually delivers the content of the book -
its data.</li>
<li>So, metadata - or metainformation - is more or less structured data,
that contains information about characteristics of other data
(objects).</li>
<li>Letâs briefly reflect on the types of metadata, that we came across
so far, before we apply these concepts in the first challenge for
today:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<em>descriptive metadata</em> holds information about the
intellectual content, such as title, author, abstractâ¦</li>
<li>
<em>administrative metadata</em> specifies how a resource is
managed. This includes things such as the terms of (re-)distribution and
copyright information. This also includes technical information about
the data (such as files included in a dataset) or versioning
informationâ¦</li>
<li>
<em>structural metadata</em> describe, for example, chapters in a
book, files in a dataset, or software components.</li>

<p><strong>Objective:</strong> <br> The learners experience a real-world
example of functional metadata applications and practice their acquired
knowledge on metadata types.</p>
<p><strong>Implementation:</strong> <br> We recommend using a
pre-structured, collaborative document (whiteboard or notepad) to
collect the participantsâ results. Allow some time for the learners to
navigate the websites and explore the metadata in the source code
individually (ca. 8 min). Open the source code of one website in the
browser and share the screen. Talking points for the guided
confrontation can be:</p>
<ul>
<li>different types of targets (e.g.Â <code>twitter:</code>,
<code>robots:</code>)</li>
<li>different contexts (e.g.Â <code>dc:</code>, <code>og:</code>); donât
go too deep into this topic, and just give a teaser about the existence
of metadata standards and references</li>
<li>
<strong>Fun fact:</strong> <em>The Guardian</em> regularly uses a

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Now letâs shift our focus to metadata annotation in the scientific
context.</li>
<li>Iâm sure many of us have been in a similar situation. You start a
new project that is based on the work of your predecessor or
collaborators and you are supposed to start with reproducing the
published resultsâ¦</li>
<li>You take a look at the accompanying publication and the data looks
neatâ¦</li>
<li>But as soon as you open the underlying datasets, understanding the
process of how this data was acquired is not so straightforward anymore.
The variables might be hard to understand, there might be missing
values, and the performed data cleaning is not necessarily
apparent.</li>
<li>So you take a look at the experimentâs documentationâ¦</li>
<li>A study by Monya Baker, which was published in Nature in 2016 was
able to show, that more than 70% of researchers have tried and failed to
reproduce another scientistâs experiments. And more than half have even
failed to reproduce their <em>own</em> experiments.</li>
<li>A rather bad practice that you can encounter in your scientific life
is surely data, saved under an uninformative file name, with no
documentation whatsoever.</li>
<li>Slightly better practice are lab notes, which are still widely used
as the go-to documentation method in experimental scientific areas.
Using lab notes as documentation method, you can facilitate the
findabilityâ¦</li>
<li>by assigning meaningful file names and dates to your data.
Howeverâ¦</li>
<li>lab notes come with various disadvantages. Lab notes are usually
taken continuously and over the course of a 3-year contract, several
hundred pages of lab notes can accumulate.</li>
<li>so even though lab notes allow for some kind of documentation, they
are largely unstructured and subjective, rarely following templates or
guidelines. Continuously taking notes makes the documentation hard to
retrieve. The notes are physically separated from the data they describe
and remain in the hand of the experimenter or institution hosting the
experiments, which makes them hard to share. And letâs admit it -
handwriting can be a <em>pain</em> to read.</li>
<li>One way to store your documentation with your data, is README-style
metadataâ¦</li>
<li>Just like taking lab notes, README-style files can be simple,
subjectively written natural text documents.</li>
<li>You can also find templates for README-style metadata records.
Sticking to these templates will allow for increased structure in your
documentation records. Now that we document our data digitally, we have
increased options to link the metadata to the described dataset, for
example by naming them accordinglyâ¦</li>
<li>If you now want to find the results of a specific experiment on your
computer, a local keyword search can help you to identify the
dataset.</li>
<li>To sum up, digital documentation of your metadata in form of
README-style metadata records, facilitates the linkage of data and
metadata, allows for local searchability and increased readability, and
the digital nature of the README file simplifies targeted sharing of the
documentation. However, these records are still rather unstructured and
subjective, and only allow for keyword searches.</li>
<li>If you want to have a look at a well-designed template for
README-style metadata records, a recommended link is provided in the
episode description.</li>

<li>With the next episode, we are diving deeper into the topic of
structured data and enhancing machine readability of our metadata
records.</li>
<li>So far we have been talking about natural language communication.
When the senior doctor gives a status update about a patientâs condition
to his colleague, the information is clear. Letâs take this message
apart and structure itâ¦</li>
<li>The message is concerning a subject, namely the specific patient in
room 305. It includes a location, the room number and it gives
information about the current condition, âunchangedâ. Letâs assume that
both doctors were machines. Extracting this information from the natural
language text wouldnât be as straightforwardâ¦</li>
<li>And the information needs to be structured in particular ways to
make it easily transferrable and accessible for the receiving end. One
popular and lightweight format to structure data is JSON, JavaScript
Object Notation. We will take an in-depth look at JSON in the upcoming
lectures.</li>

<p><strong>Time estimate</strong>: 15 min</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The first term that we will come across regularly throughout this
lesson is <em>Markup</em>.</li>
<li>You encounter markup continuously when you read a text. A period,
for example, indicates the end of a declarative or imperative sentence,
which results in the speaker briefly stopping to talk, if reading out
loud. The question mark, on the other hand, declares a question and a
speaker will, in many languages, raise their voice before pausing at the
end of the sentence. In this sense, the punctuation - or Markup - is not
part of the text or information by itself. It rather provides some
additional information about the text.</li>
<li>Essential for functional markup is that the sender, in the case of a
text, the writer and the recipient - the reader - agree on the
interpretation of the symbols used to markup the text. Shown here is an
<em>interrobang</em>, a combination of a question mark and an
exclamation point. (<em>You can reactivate the audience by asking them,
whether someone is familiar with the definition of the interrobang or if
they would know how to interpret it.</em>) The interrobang was proposed
in the 1960s as a new punctuation mark to indicate a rhetorical
question. As you might have guessed already, the proposal did not come
very far.</li>
<li>Markup can be distinguished into four different types:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>punctuational markup, as seen in the previous examples.</li>
<li>presentational markup gives information on how the text should be
displayed, which includes vertical or horizontal spacing, page breaks,
and enumerations of lists. When enclosing text between two asterisks
while writing Markdown, a Markdown interpreter will display this text in
bold font face.</li>
<li>descriptive or declarative markup gives information on the type or
class the enclosed text belongs to. In this example, the text was
enclosed by an H1 opening and closing tag. HTML interpreters will now
know, that this sentence is the most important headline on the page,
regardless of how it is displayed.</li>
<li>referential markup refers to entities external to the document. On a
website, this marked-up sentence would appear as a link and redirect the
user to the specified URL, when activated.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Iâm certain all of us have manually marked up a document in one way
or another, using a text marker while reading a journal publication or
commenting on a manuscript while reviewing it. These markups give
information to the human reader: What is important in this text? What
information is missing? Markup in computer files, however, is targeting
a machine for interpretation. It declares how the content should be
formatted or printed, or give additional information on the written
words.</li>
<li>So from now on in this lecture, the term markup will refer to markup
that targets computers, mainly descriptive and referential markup.</li>
<li>Descriptive and referential markup, used rigorously, is a way to
make data and natural text more accessible for computer analysis and can
provide additional information for the human user as well. But we will
come to that in a bit.</li>
<li>We will first shift our focus to the importance of the
interoperability of the data formats that we want to use to document our
data and metadata. In the 1980s, roughly 10 years before the birth of
the World Wide Web, the internet was already a thing and national and
international data networks were emerging fast. This increased the need
for standardized data transfer formats to facilitate data exchange and
interpretability on various machines in one network. One of the first
industry standards for electronic publishing was the âStandard
Generalized <strong>Markup</strong> Languageâ, or SGML.</li>
<li>With the implementation of the World Wide Web, HTML - the HyperText
<strong>Markup</strong> Language - became the standard language for web
pages and has its roots in SGML. The markup tags of HTML and their
interpretation are well-defined. XML - the eXtensible
<strong>Markup</strong> Language - on the other hand, was developed to
transfer and store data on the World Wide Web. The tags are arbitrary,
descriptive and can be defined by the user. Letâs take a closer
look.</li>
<li>This XML example stores data in form of natural text (<em>point to
the two sentences</em>) and a number (<em>highlight the â1â</em>). Each
of these data elements is enclosed in a start and end tag. As mentioned
before, these tags can be defined arbitrarily, so we state, that the
first sentence is the title, the second sentence is a description and
the number one represents a word count. We can now introduce a data
hierarchy, declaring that all these data elements describe one example.
We could now look for the âtitleâ of the âexampleâ and retrieve the data
stored between those tags. XML is software- and hardware-independent and
still widely used as a data exchange format. Though XML is
human-readable, enclosing the data between start and end tags is quite
an effort and meddles with the clarity of this format. So we are leaving
the realm of markup languagesâ¦</li>
<li>to introduce another data exchange format, which is recommended as a
standard from the W3 consortium: JSON. JSON is short for JavaScript
Object notation. It is based on the representation for data objects in
JavaScript - the main programming language of the Web - and bears all
the advantages XML has shown, such as lightweight data exchange,
software and hardware independence, and hierarchical structure - with an
increased human readability. For the remainder of this lesson, we will
learn how to read, write and standardize JSON object literals.</li>

<p><strong>Time estimate</strong>: 7 min</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Letâs have a closer look at the structure and syntax of JSON object
literals.</li>
<li>In this example we have a JSON object, which describes a person
named John.</li>
<li>Objects are enclosed in curly braces.</li>
<li>Within these objects, data entities are stored in key-value
pairs.</li>
<li>Keys are always of the data type âstringâ</li>
<li>Data values can be given as one of the following data types. They
can be given asâ¦</li>
<li>strings.</li>
<li>String values can contain any kind of characters and are typically
enclosed in double quotes. Each string, no matter how long it is, will
be interpreted as a single value.</li>
<li>Numbersâ¦</li>
<li>can be either integers or floats.</li>
<li>Booleansâ¦</li>
<li>Boolean values in JSON have one of two possible values. It is either
true or false.</li>
<li>Nullâ¦</li>
<li>Assigning the data type NULL does not mean the same as zero but
rather that no value was assigned to this variable. You might be
familiar with other representations, such as NA or nan. If you read a
JSON object into Python, for example, NULL will be parsed as
<code>None</code>.</li>
<li>Values in JSON can also be arrays. For example, John has two
parents, Anna and Michael.</li>
<li>An array is a collection of multiple elements and can be understood
as a list of values. The data elements within an array can have the same
data type or vary in their data types.</li>
<li>Last but not least, a value can be another object. John has a pet
and the value of the key âpetâ is an object describing Johnâs dog
Brutus.</li>
<li>Again, an object contains key-value pairs. These key-value pairs are
separated by commas and enclosed by curly braces.</li>
<li>The separation of data entities by commas in a JSON object literal
is crucial.</li>
<li>JSON is not sensitive to indentations and line breaks. However,
indentation and line breaks can significantly increase the human
readability of the JSON object literal. Now letâs compare the JSON
representation of this object with its XML representationâ¦</li>
<li>Both representations contain the same information. In XML the data
value is stored between start and end tags, whereas in JSON, the value
is assigned to a property and separated from other entries with a comma.
Both representations allow for hierarchical data storage as seen for the
description of Johnâs pet. In JSON this is done by nesting objects, in
XML the data entries are enclosed by <code>&lt;pet&gt;</code> tags. A
difference can be seen in the representation for Johnâs parents. Whereas
an array is given in the JSON object literal, comparable lists do not
exist in XML. Here the parentsâ names are enclosed individually with the
same start and end tags.</li>
<li>Besides XML and JSON, the third widely used standard data exchange
format is YAML. JSON and YAML can be parsed into one another.</li>
<li>(<em>Allow some time for questions.</em>)</li>

<li>Before we dive deeper into the topic of metadata and how we can make
it more accessible, we would like to travel a few decades back and have
a quick glimpse at the technical advancements, that paved the way for
us, to share data across the globe instantaneously: the internet and the
world wide web.</li>
<li>Letâs travel back to the 1960s, when computers still looked like
this (<em>point to bottom right corner </em>). Computers became
increasingly common in work environments, especially universities,
research institutes and governmental agencies.</li>
<li>With this advancements, the need to share data between computers
arose and local network technologies were developed. Within the
institutions, the computers were linked with cablesâ¦</li>
<li>and communication protocols were developed, that allowed the
transfer of data between computers in the local area network and
controlled the means of data distribution.</li>
<li>This was a development that naturally occurred on many sites
simultaneously and soon the scientific drive to collaborate was aiming
to use this new technology to share data quickly across
inter-institutional boundariesâ¦</li>
<li>However, there was a major issue. The individual networks were using
different communication protocols, that were largely incompatible with
each other.</li>
<li>To solve this problem, two researchers at the US Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency, Vint Cerf &amp; Bob Kahn, worked hard on a
solution. In 1974 they introduced the Transmission Control Protocol /
Internet Protocol â TCP / IP, a term you have certainly heard at some
point.</li>
<li>This Internet Protocol Suite finally enabled communication between
networks. It was soon declared as the standard for all military computer
networking and adopted by research organizations as well as large
communication companies. The internet, the network of networks, was born
and Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn will become known as the fathers of the
internet. That the TCP / IP protocol developed to a global standard for
communication between networks, can be attributedâ¦</li>
<li>to another decision based in academia. In 1989, the University of
California, Berkley, decided to share their TCP/IP code with the world
and put it under public domain; free for anyone to use.</li>
<li>And today, computer networks all over the world are connected with
each other over uncountable miles of cablesâ¦</li>
<li>Crossing the oceans.</li>
<li>Now, that communication between networks was secured, the way was
free for applications running on top of the Internet Protocol Suite. And
scientists love to communicate, right? So again, to researchers at the
University of California â Jon Postel and Suzanne Sluizer â developed
the Mail Tranfer Protocol. No more letters, no more making appointments
for phone calls, but sharing information instantaneously by email.</li>
<li>Meanwhile in Europe, two computer scientists shared the vision to
implement an application for the internet, that â<em>serves as a
collaborative space where you can communicate through sharing
information</em>â.</li>
<li>These two were Tim Berners-Lee and Robert Caillauâ¦</li>
<li>at the CERN research center in Geneva Switzerland. They wrote a
joint proposal for the âWorld Wide Webâ, which aimed to â<em>meet the
demand for automated information-sharing between scientists in
universities and institutes around the world</em>â.So the World Wide Web
was, from its beginning, meant to facilitate scientific data
exchange.</li>
<li>So to distinguish the World Wide Web from the internet: The internet
is the global network connecting local networks with each other and
allowing them to communicate. The World Wide Web is a service, that runs
on top of the internet which allows to search, get and share data.</li>
<li>And this was all established in a very familiar, academic
environment. The name of this data sharing application, was discussed at
lunch in the cafeteria.</li>
<li>Based on the early protocols, the building blocks of todayâs World
Wide Web were developed - HTML, which is still the standard markup
language for documents designed to be interpreted by and displayed in
web browsers. The HyperText Transfer Protocol, which is an application
layer protocol to ensure client-server communication on the Web. And
URIs, Uniform Resource Identifiers, which uniquely identify resources on
the web and ensure their accessibility and retrievability. We will come
back to these technologiesâ¦</li>
<li>tomorrow, when we discuss how data is transferred on the World Wide
Web and the importance of web identifiers.</li>
<li>Coming back to this 1989 picture, we havenât talked about this young
woman sitting next to Tim Berners-Lee.</li>
<li>Her name is Nicola Pellow and back in 1990 she was still studying
Mathematics and Information Science at Leicester Polytechnic. She went
to Switzerland for an internship in the research group of Tim
Berners-Lee and Robert Caillau and as a student internâ¦</li>
<li>she developed the first operation system independent web browser,
the Line Mode Browser, making the world wide web accessible on many
computers.</li>
<li>Within the scientific community, the World Wide Web was an immediate
success. Already in 1991, the arXiv preprint repository switched from
email dissemination of manuscripts to HTTP. The picture on the right
gives an insight how scientific article were distributed before the
World Wide Web. You couldnât simply click on any article that you found
on Google Scholar and download it - provided it isnât hidden behind a
paywall - and decide later, whether it was helpful or not. You needed to
exactly know which article you want to study, contact the archiving
repository, wait for an actual human being to retrieve the article, scan
it and send it back to you. (<em>To reactivate the learners, you can ask
them at this point, who has a folder on their drive for âunread
articlesâ or âarticles to readâ.</em>). The first German institute to
connect a web server to the Web was the âDeutsches
Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY. (<em>Well, the lesson was created within
the Helmholtz Association in Germany, which makes this a nice Fun Fact
for the original audience. Feel free to substitute with some other
relevant institution relevant to your learners</em>).</li>
<li>Today the web hosts so many repositories for research articles and
data - global, local, very general or highly domain-specific - that it
becomes hard to find the right repository for the resource you want to
retrieve or upload. Needless to say that you can find several
repositories for repositories online. To sum it up, the World Wide Web
was originally created to share data between scientists and scientific
institutions, and it succeeded so well, that today it is barely
imaginable to conduct research without the Web.</li>
<li>The take away-message of this brief history lesson is that the World
Wide Web was created by scientist for scientist to promote data sharing
and collaboration in a scholarly environment across physical borders.
And the decision of CERN to put all the components of Web software in
the public Domain paved the way for the web as we know it today.</li>

<p><strong>Slide set</strong>: <a href="../files/slideSet/12_MetadataSchemas_CarpentriesIncubator_ScientificMetadata.pdf" target="_blank">MetadataSchemas.pdf</a></p>
<p><strong>Time estimate</strong>: 10 min</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Even though the World Wide Web has provided the means of sharing
information with individuals and broad communities easily, we have
experienced yesterday and in our daily life as researchers, that simply
sharing data does not guarantee the reusability of this information. And
we have all experienced the yearning for guidelines on how this
information should be provided. So we will now introduce you to metadata
schemas. (<em>You can also show a slide with the JSON object literal
results from day 1 at this point or learner quotes from the result
discussion of Challenge 3.</em>)</li>
<li>With a metadata schema, it is possible to express requirements on
how a metadata record should be structured and even enforce this
structure.</li>
<li>An example of validated and enforced data submission we are probably
all familiar with is the classic customer information form that you need
to fill out when you are placing an order in an online shop.</li>
<li>We know these asterisks tell us that these data entries are
required. Some entries only allow string values, like the name, or
specific formats, like e-mail addresses and will throw an error as soon
as you diverge from the expected data type or format. Or you have a
fixed subset of values, which you can pick from a drop-down list.</li>
<li>If you press submit, the data in this form will be validated and, if
it passes this validation, stored or used in other applications. This
means that it will be stored and transmitted in some suitable common
data format such as JSON.</li>
<li>The names of the fields specify the keys - or properties of the JSON
objectâ¦</li>
<li>and below you can find a description of the data values that are
supposed to be entered.</li>
<li>For metadata records in general, these conventions or constraints
can be set by metadata schemas. These schemas are defined in the same
data format as the expected metadata record, such as XML or JSON. Again,
this allows for parsing and automated validation.</li>
<li>This means, XML schemas are written in XML and JSON schema is
written in JSON. So far, we have written JSON object literals and we
will be further focusing on JSONâ¦</li>
<li>so we will take a deeper look at JSON Schema.</li>
<li>On the right, you see a simple JSON Schema, which is a JSON object
that is following the JSON Schema standard. This is indicated by the
â$schemaâ-key, which is used as a version identifier and points to the
location of the schema specification. The value of this keyword must be
an URI. We will tackle the topic of referencing in metadata records
later in this lesson.</li>
<li>The schema specifies keys - or properties - that require to enter a
data value. In this caseâ¦</li>
<li>The superhero property is required and expects an entry of data
type: string.</li>
<li>A second property is defined: power. However, power is not listed in
the required properties, so it is optional.</li>
<li>Coming back to the data types: This schema specifies a JSON
<strong>object</strong> in which the superhero-value should be a
<strong>string</strong> and the power-value needs to be of data type
<strong>integer</strong>. And for the human reader, some meaningful
descriptions are added to describe the individual properties.</li>
<li>Based on this example schema, the object on top would be valid. A
string value is assigned to the required property. The bottom object,
however, does not conform with the schema and would throw an error, as
the value data type is not a string. <strong>It is important to
know</strong>, that schema validation only checks for syntactical
validity. In this case, it only checks, whether the object contains the
required property, the corresponding value and whether the value
conforms with the expected data type. To prevent nonsensical values, a
meaningful property description can be of great help.â</li>
<li><em>(Allow some time for questions.)</em></li>
<li>Before we write a JSON schema for our roller coaster experiment
data, letâs get back to the customer information form and design a JSON
schema together that enforces the data entries for this form.</li>

</h3>
<p>The concept of a schema can be overwhelming for learners with little
to no prior knowledge. To prepare the learners for Challenge 4, we
recommend to include an <strong>interactive live coding
session</strong>. The following instructions and suggestions are based
on the narrative we follow in our course setup.</p>
<p><strong>Time</strong>: 8 min</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Creatorâs recommendation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduce a customer information form as an example for data
validation / enforcement in your lecture.</li>
<li>Open the image of the customer information form and an empty JSON

<ul>
<li>For live coding, we recommend using an <strong>IDE</strong> with
<strong>JSON syntax highlighting</strong> (e.g.Â VS Code)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Narrative / Teaching script</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>start off with 2 indentations</em></li>
<li>demonstrate specifying the first property in the form
<code>"Full Name"</code> by entering a meaningful
<code>"description"</code> and <code>"type": "string"</code>
</li>
<li>encourage the learners to shout out the values (and keys), that
specify the subsequent form properties.</li>
<li>highlight the following aspects:
<ul>
<li>
<code>"Country/Region"</code>: to restrict a value to a fixed set of
values, the keyword <code>"enum"</code> is used. Fixed values are
specified in an <code>array</code> of unique elements.</li>
<li>
<code>"Number of super powers"</code>: introduce
<code>"type": "number"</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>"E-mail"</code>: introduce the <code>"format"</code>-keyword.
<code>"format": "email"</code> validates against the correct formatting
of an e-mail address (<code>someString</code> - <code>@-sign</code> -
<code>domain name</code>). However, it does <strong>not</strong> check
whether the e-mail address exists.</li>
<li>
<code>"Date of birth"</code>: specify <code>date</code>-format.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The specified keywords represent the
<code>"properties"</code> of the
<code>customerInformation</code>-object</strong></li>
<li>the <code>"properties"</code>-key of a JSON schema object takes a
value of data type <code>object</code> -&gt; <em>enclose the specified
field-objects in curly brackets</em>
</li>
<li>collaboratively define the JSON schema keys <code>"title"</code>,
<code>"description"</code>, and <code>"type"</code>
</li>
<li>highlight, that a JSON schema is a <strong>JSON object
literal</strong> -&gt; <em>enclose the schema-object in curly
brackets</em>
</li>
<li>Finally, draw the learnersâ attention to the
<strong>mandatory</strong> fields in the customer information form and
introduce the <code>"required"</code>-keyword</li>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Letâs have a last look at our roller coaster data.</li>
<li>Yesterday morning, we started with a cryptic dataset, that was
simply not understandable without further information. We were even
guessing the meaning of the chosen variable namesâ¦</li>
<li>after putting the dataset in context, we did not only know, how to
read the dataâ¦</li>
<li>but also who recorded the data, the test object and when it was
recordedâ¦</li>
<li>and which conditions applied to this particular experiment.</li>
<li>By structuring our metadata records as JSON objectsâ¦</li>
<li>we made the information not only findable but also accessible to
machines. As we put some effort into developing a schema for the
metadata records, we can make sure, that experiments in the same study
and collaboration, are recorded and annotated in the same way, which
increases its reusabilityâ¦</li>
<li>and ensures, that metadata records can be validated.</li>
<li>(<em>If you like, recommend some tools that support and facilitate
metadata annotation and validation.</em> For more information on the
examples in the slides, visit the <a href="https://github.com/Materials-Data-Science-and-Informatics/dirschema" target="_blank" class="external-link">DirSchema</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Materials-Data-Science-and-Informatics/metador-push" target="_blank" class="external-link">Metador</a> Github repositories.)</li>
<li>With the metadata schema you have developed, you made sure, that
every researcher in the collaboration annotates their data in the same
meaningful way. Collaborating in this closed circle was made a lot
easier.</li>
<li>But now imagine that you want to analyse published data by some
other scientist in your research field. Someone, who is not part of your
collaborationâ¦</li>
<li>Wouldnât it be nice, if this data would be annotated in the same way
as yours?! We will dive deeper into community-wide metadata schemas and

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>We have been discussing metadata schemas to enforce, harmonize and
validate metadata records. But you might have heard the term metadata
standards. So where is the difference?</li>
<li>Basically, a metadata standard is a metadata schema. A schema can
become a standard when it is well-established, endorsed, and widely
accepted by its user community.</li>
<li>One of the best-known, generic, and widely used metadata standard
for online resources, is the Dublin Core. The Dublin Core was developed
by a consortium of researchers, librarians, and web technologists in
1995 during a meeting in Dublin, Ohio, and was born by the need for a
unified description of resources on the web. The design of the Dublin
Core was inspired by the library cards as they are still used to catalog
book resources in physical libraries.</li>
<li>When we are talking about online resources, we talk about any
information entity that can be retrieved from the web, such as websites,
metadata and data files, images, videos, and so on. In the scientific
context, âresourceâ can also refer to experimental data, protocols, or
software code. Have you published anything under your name online? Guess
what: in terms of the world wide web, you are a resource, too!</li>
<li>To enhance the identification and findability of these resources,
the Dublin Core Initiative has specified a set of 15 metadata elements
to describe any type of resource on the Web. These core elements hold
information on the creators, format and type, and detailed descriptions
of the resource.</li>
<li>Remember the first challenge we approached yesterday? When looking
up metadata elements in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>-elements of
websitesâ¦</li>
<li>some properties were given as <code>dc:</code>, such as - in this
example - <code>dc:creator</code>, directly stating, that this entry
conforms with the <code>creator</code> element of the
<code>Dublin Core</code> metadata standard.</li>
<li>The Dublin Core is just one of many implemented and endorsed
metadata standards. On the general online resource description,
Facebookâs Open Graph and schema.org became industry metadata standards.
But, you guessed it, there are multiple community specific and
scientific metadata standards, that describe scientific resources in
more detail.</li>

<p><strong>Objective:</strong> <br> The learners are aware of metadata
standard registries and know how to navigate them.</p>
<p><strong>Creatorâs recommendation:</strong> <br> After giving the
challenge instructions, allow for some time for the learners to explore
the registries (ca. 15 min). Start a screen share of one on the metadata
registries and navigate to a metadata standard of your liking. Talking
points could be: - different representations of metadata standards (JSON
/ XML schema, RDF, SKOS, OWL) - granularity of representation
(e.g.Â high-level standard vs.Â application-specific standard) - terms,
properties, specifications - accompanying journal publications</p>
<p><strong>Transition to â(Web) Locations and Identifiersâ:</strong>
During the discussion, ask the group of learners, whether someone
encountered a <code>404 Error</code> while exploring a metadata
standard. If you are working with a heterogeneous group regarding their
scientific background, chances are high, that at least one of the
learners had this experience (-&gt; it is not unusual that the
development of a metadata standard in a specific research field was
concluded and the maintenance of the web representation was terminated
at the end of the funding period.)</p>

<li>Letâs get back to the World Wide Web.</li>
<li>Today we take a look at the Web and all information stored on it,
that we carry in our pockets.</li>
<li>It accompanies us throughout the day. Streaming your favorite show,
looking for recipes, shopping, banking, connecting with friends â the
internet and the Web are involved in a large share of our daily
activities.</li>
<li>Going back to the roots of the World Wide Web, itâs original idea
was âto be a collaborative space where you can communicate through
sharing informationâ.</li>
<li>And we are sharing information and communicating more than ever.
Everything in the blink of an eye. The World Wide Web is now an
essential tool for every researcher. Reading publications, connecting
with other scientists, retrieving and publishing data, accessing servers
on the other side of the globe, and even attending conferences and
meetings with people hundreds and thousands of miles away from you. In
the sense of the original idea of the Web, science became faster and
communicating information easier. Its means to access information are so
manifold, that retrieving relevant and meaningful information comes with
new challenges.</li>
<li>The Web is a hypermedia system, connecting a multitude of resources
via hyperlinks. We have already heard the term <strong>resource</strong>
earlier and in the next couple of minutes we will get a bit more
technical, talking about data retrieval on the Web and Web resources. So
letâs define briefly, what the term <strong>Web Resource</strong>
actually means.</li>
<li>A Web resource can be digital in nature, such as computer code,
documents, videos, and images. These resources can immediately be
retrieved or viewed on the Web in a browser.</li>
<li>But the term <strong>Web resource</strong> encompasses more than
just digital resources. Physical and abstract entities, for example
persons, art, buildings, and mathematical concepts are also Web
resources once they are somehow represented on the Web.</li>
<li>Hence, any entity - digital, physical or abstract - that is
represented on the Web is a Web resource.</li>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>In yesterdayâs lecture on the origins of the World Wide Web, we had
a brief glimpse at the building blocks of the web.</li>
<li>We have discussed Markup Languages yesterday morning as means to
communicate representation and structure of a text document to the
machine.</li>
<li>This lecture will focus on the other two essential building blocks
of the webâs technological backbone.</li>
<li>Remember the first lecture from yesterday? We have had a close look
on the metadata in a book. Now if a librarian wants to identify a
specific publicationâ¦</li>
<li>they will use its ISBN for unambiguous identification. This ISBN
follows a standardized structure, which gives valuable information about
the resource, such as the group and publisher of the book. This ISBN is
globally unique. Which means it only exists for one specific book and
will always lead to the same result, where ever you retrieve it.</li>
<li>And these uniform resource identifiers also exist in the scientific
context. Let me give you an example from molecular biology. Letâs say,
this scientist is working on genetics and she is interested in the
functions of a specific gene in the model plantâ¦</li>
<li>
<em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em>. Every gene of this plant has an
unique identifier assigned, that follows certain representative
conventions. In the case of this model plant, the gene identifier holds
information on the species, the chromosome, the type of sequence as well
as its location on the chromosome.</li>
<li>To generalize, unique identifiers enable globally unique
identification of a resource. The structure of these identifiers is
standardized and they are registered centrally, enabling a uniform
structure of these identifiers globally or in the user community. This
makes unique identifiers unambiguous and dereferencable.</li>
<li>(<em>Use this slide to collect unique identifiers in the research
fields of the learners. We like to do this in a brief plenary
discussion, asking the learners to share unique identifiers, they use
regularly and what they represent.</em>)</li>
<li>Now we will take this concept of uniform identifiers to the
Web.</li>
<li>But first, we will need to define and distinguish between a few
terms, that come up frequently in this context. The examples we have
seen a couple of minutes ago, are - simply put - a series of
structurally harmonized characters that uniquely identify a
resourceâ¦</li>
<li>The ISBN number we have seen, is basically just a âsynonymâ for a
book. (It acts to the book like a synonym acts to another word). This
is, what we call a URN, Uniform Resource <strong>Name</strong>. We know,
what the resource is called.</li>
<li>This name under a certain namespace, is uniform and unique. But the
name gives no clue, on how we can retrieve the information stored behind
this name. We do not know itâs location and the technical necessities to
access it.</li>
<li>To do so on the web, we need the addressâ¦</li>
<li>where we can find the resource with a specific resource. The address
alone is not enough, though. We also need information on how we can
retrieve the resourceâ¦</li>
<li>This is specified by the communication protocol. We will focus on
this technology in a minute. These information are given as a Uniform
Resource Locator, URL: a series of characters, that specify the address
of a resource and the protocol necessary to retrieve this resource.</li>
<li>Both, URN and URL, can be used to identify a specific resource. You
either need the name or the location, to identify data on the Web. So
URN and URL <strong>are</strong> Uniform Resource Identifiers.</li>
<li>We will further focus on URLs and the technology hidden behind this
string of characters, that we enter to open a resource on the Web.</li>
<li>And for this we take the URL that retrieves the information for our
gene example from couple of minutes ago. So letâs decode this character
set: The resource we are looking for, isâ¦</li>
<li>provided on a specific server, the host. To explain which resource
we want to get, the path in the URL gives a kind of âlocation addressâ
to the server, so it knows where to find what we are looking for. The
final resource might be stored in a database structure. So the necessary
query parameter are specified that lead to the database entry for the
requested resource. For now, this is just a ânice to knowâ and we will
disregard these specifications in our examples. Donât forget, we will
need to follow a specific protocol, in this case HTTPS, in order to
communicate with the host server. HTTPS is an extension of the Hypertext
Transfer Protocol, that uses encryption technology for secure
communication on the network.</li>
<li>So here we have reached the third and final building block of the
World Wide Web.</li>
<li>If we now enter this URL in our browser, the browser sends a HTTP
request to the server.</li>
<li>This request specifies, that the browser wants to
<strong>GET</strong> a resource stored under a <strong>specific
path</strong> from the <strong>host</strong> and follows the specific
HTTP protocol that is used for communication, which is also expected by
the browser of the server response.</li>
<li>The host server then looks up the specified file path locally. Finds
the requested file andâ¦</li>
<li>sends back the HTTP response, with the requested resource.</li>
<li>The response also includes a status code. The code â200: okâ tells
the client-server, that sends the request, âI have found the file you
requested. Here you go!â. There are various status codes for
server-client communication, but for now, we will focus on the most
common ones. The client, your browser, receives the response with the
resource attached andâ¦</li>
<li>displays it.</li>
<li>But Iâm fairly sure, we have all experienced this situation: You are
looking for publications online, be it data or a journal article. The
abstract is super promising and you want to retrieve the PDFâ¦</li>
<li>but instead of the publication, you are faced with an <strong>Error
404</strong>. We speak of rotten links.</li>
<li>So what happened here? You click on the link and the familiar HTTP
request is sent by your browser to the host server.</li>
<li>Again, the host server follows the file path but it is leading into
the void. No file with this path.</li>
<li>And this is, what the host server communicates back to your browser.
The HTTP response now contains the status code <strong>404: Not
Found</strong>.</li>
<li>Letâs take a look at this client-server communication in
action.</li>
<li>Simplified, there could be two reasons why you end up with a 404
status code: either you canât spell correctly, or the path to the
resource is broken.</li>
<li>How do paths break.</li>
<li>The URL you want to retrieve points to a specific resource, which
are stored on another server. But within the life cycle of a Web
resource, several events can take place.</li>
<li>The file path on the host server might change, the resource might be
migrated to a different host server, or the resource might simply be
deleted. In any of these cases, the URL does not specify the exact
location of the resource any longer and will no longer be retrievable
following the <strong>GET</strong> request you send from your browser.
This process is also referred to as âlink rotâ. Remember, that we
classified the URL as a form of Uniform Resource Identifier? This means,
that link rot results in the resource losing a very important
identifier!</li>

<p><strong>Slide set</strong>: <a href="../files/slideSet/19_PersistentIdentifier_CarpentriesIncubator_ScientificMetadata.pdf" target="_blank">PersistentIdentifier.pdf</a></p>
<p><strong>Time estimate</strong>: 8 min</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Web technology has a solution for this issue: Persistent Identifiers
or short, PIDs.</li>
<li>Like our other persistent and unique identifiers, such as ISBNs,
PIDs are long-lasting references to digital objects on the Web. Any
resource that has a representation on the web - articles, datasets,
persons, instruments - can have a PID assigned. These PIDs remain
constant over time, lead indirectly to the resource - so they also give
information on the location and protocol - and, thus, ensure permanent
identifiability, referenceabilty and retrievability of online
resources.</li>
<li>The technology behind PIDs is fairly simple. In essence a PID
service resembles the basic functionality of a phone book, where the PID
identifies the resource in question, like a name in a phone book but
unique. The PID is associated with an URL, that locates the
resource.</li>
<li>In PID databases, a PID is mapped to a URL, that retrieves a
resource. Even though the URL changes, due to server migration or
changes in the file path, the PID remains consistent.</li>
<li>If you activate a hyperlink in your browser to retrieve a resource
without a PID service included, your browser will directly communicate
with the host server to retrieve a resource.</li>
<li>If the requested resource is identified by a PID, the underlying PID
service will be contacted by the browser. The PID service will then
query its database for the PID, identify the current URL of the resource
and redirect the request to the host server.</li>
<li>So when the location of the resource changesâ¦</li>
<li>a PID will not lead to unretrievable resources and rotten
linksâ¦</li>
<li>as the new URL is stored in the PID resolver service and the
activated link will redirect the request to the new location.</li>
<li>It is important to know, that the PID service <strong>only</strong>
provides the <strong>technical infrastructure</strong> for redirections.
The registrar of the requested resource - which could be a private
person, a journal that published an article or a repository that holds a
dataset - <strong>is responsible for updating the URL</strong>. For
example: You publish an article and one of the journals assigns a PID to
this article. If the journal now changes the digital location of your
article on their server, the journal is responsible to inform the PID
provider about the changes and update the location.</li>
<li>PID technology, however, comes with a significant challenge.</li>
<li>If the PID provider discontinues itâs services, it would lead to a
huge amount of broken links and irretrievable resources. Therefore it is
important, to choose well-established and sustainable PID service.</li>
<li>In the scientific environment, we daily deal with various resources
represented on the Web.</li>
<li>Non-profit services have been established in the scholar world, to
provide sustainable PIDs for academic Web resources. Researchers can
register an ORCiD ID, short for Open Researcher and Contributor ID.
Academic institutions and funding agencies can be identified by their
Research Organization Registry handle, short ROR. And once you look for
scientific publications, you will inevitably get in contact with a
DOI.</li>
<li>The Digital Object Identifier is a digital identifier of an object,
any object â physical, digital, or abstract. It is not exclusively used
for academic Web resources but can be used to register and identify any
resource represented on the Web.</li>
<li>In the academic environment, it is largely used to identify research
articles, data objects, metadata records, code, and software.</li>
<li>For these academic Web resources, DOIs can be issued by different
DOI providers, most commonly Data Cite and Crossref. Many repositories
and scientific journals assign published resources with a DOI, often in
collaboration with DataCite or Crossref. These providers guarantee
long-lasting retrievability of any data object in their database.</li>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>So, where is the link between PIDs and Metadata?</li>
<li>For this, we will have a closer look on the ORCiD. If you resolve an
ORCiD on the Web, you will get to a website that contains all the
information of a researcher, that this person has provided about
themself. You can specify employments, education, publications, awards,
and grants as well as location details, keywords, and external links. In
other words, your ORCiD comes with all the necessary metadata about your
professional life. Plus, it is unique but your name may not be. Imagine,
you are looking for a publication by John Smith. Without additional
information, it would be almost impossible to find a publication by the
exact John Smith on arXiv or Google Scholar in a reasonable amount of
time. Even if you look up Bruce Wayne on Google Scholar, you will find
more than one author with this name.</li>
<li>An ORCiD ID is an unique and persistent identifier for
researchers.</li>
<li>The ORCiD service comes with more than an unique, persistent
identifier. It comes with an ORCiD record, in other words a metadata
record, that connected to each ORCID ID. And the service also provides
technical tools, with which this metadata can be retrieved.</li>
<li>So all the information that is visible on this pageâ¦</li>
<li>is connected with a metadata object, that looks somewhat like this.
A structured metadata object including all the information about your
person, that you like to share. [<em>side note: the JSON object is based
on the original ORCID schema. However, ORCiD uses XML.</em>]</li>
<li>Now, letâs say, you want to publish a dataset or journal paper and
attach all the necessary metadata. In order to add all the
bibliographical information to unambiguously identify you as the author,
you might need to include many details. And you might have been one of
many authors. So you need to repeat this process for your co-authors as
well. If you have an ORCiD, you can just use the PID as an identifier
for your name and your information can be retrieved automatically.</li>
<li>And if your information changes â for example you got married and
your name changed, or you started a new job and your contact information
was updated â you only need to include the update in your ORCiD
record.</li>
<li>Your ID stays the same, thus you do not have to touch your dataset
metadata records again. Your ORCiD ID will automatically resolve to the
updated personal information.</li>
<li>Similarly, when you register a DOI â letâs say for a dataset or a
journal publication â you will give metadata on this data object, that
will be saved with the DOI. So whenever you reference this exact
resource, for example if you publish several papers referring to the
same data, you need the DOI as an identifier and further meta
information about the data set can be retrieved automatically.</li>
<li>To sum it up, PIDs ensure sustainable retrievability of any kind of
web resource, they can be used to unambiguously identify resources on
the Web and PIDs are connected to metadata records, which describe the
resource in question.</li>
<li>These are certainly benefits for any human interactor with the
resource.</li>
<li>But letâs stay with the DOI a bit longer.</li>
<li>Remember the journal paper we examined yesterday?</li>
<li>One crucial metadatum we found was the DOI.</li>
<li>Letâs see what happens, when we retrieve this DOI in a Browser.
(<em>Switch to a browser window and continue with âGuided confrontation:
DOI Recordâ</em>)</li>
<li><strong>Optional slide to discuss the structure of the PID
record</strong></li>
<li>PID records are stored with the PID resolver service. They are
targeted especially at machines and hold machine-readable information.
These information support machine-actionability for interoperability. We
will take a closer look on this in the next section.</li>

<li>Going back to our journal paper example.</li>
<li>Humans are trained to scan these representations for information. If
we are looking for a specific publication, e.g.Â on a certain topic,
published by a specific author, or in a certain journal, we can easily
scan this page and decide in a short amount of time, whether the article
suits our requirements or not.</li>
<li>As we have discussed yesterday, the machine only sees glyphs,
formats, structure, etc. In order to extract information from such an
article automatically, sophisticated algorithms - like natural language
processing - would be required. In other words: automatically retrieving
key information from resources that are targeted at a human audience, is
slow and costly. To speed up this process, machine-actionable and
interoperable representations of the resource are necessary.</li>
<li>And this leads us back to PIDs and specifically the PID Records. We
have seen previously, how the PID resolver service stores the current
location of a resource and redirects client requests for a resource.
Additionally, the PID resolver stores the PID record - metadata that
describes the resource.</li>
<li>This enables new possibilities for requests made by the client.
Instead of asking for a redirect to the actual resource, the machine can
now request the PID recordâ¦</li>
<li>and even specify the format in which the metadata is supposed to be
presented. This makes the client-PID resolver interaction much faster
and accessed dataâ¦</li>
<li>is delivered in a light-weight and machine-readable format. This
allows the machine to access the information about the resource
immediately without any costly and lengthy workarounds.</li>
<li>By now it might not surprise you, that PID services request metadata
that conform to a certain schema with every resource that is registered.
Here you see a snippet of the PID Record Schema from Crossref written in
XSD. Whenever a publication, data set, or any other resource is
registered with Crossref to get a DOI, Crossref will request
meta-information that validate against this schema.</li>
<li>Just a little nice-to-know: Should you come across the term
<strong>âKernel Information Profileâ</strong> while researching metadata
- it is just another name for a <strong>PID Record Schema</strong>.</li>
<li>One more thing. When you were researching domain specific standards
in Challenge 6, you might have come across PIDs in the standards you
examined. Let me show you an example.</li>
<li>âAllosteric moleculeâ is a term defined in the âMolecular
Interactionsâ controlled vocabulary.</li>
<li>In the documentation of the term, you can find an identifier - MI,
which stands for the Molecular Interactions Standard, 1159. Associated
with this term is also a location, that starts with
<code>purl</code>.</li>
<li>A PURL or Persistent URL is a form of PID. Requesting this location
will lead to a redirect to the current location - URL - of the
resource.</li>
<li>If we follow the PURL of the âallosteric moleculeâ termâ¦</li>
<li>we will be redirected to this record on the Ontobee Web service.
This record holds the same definition as seen on the previous page and
additional annotation information.</li>
<li>The persistent URL is here specified as <code>Term IRI</code>.</li>
<li>IRI stands for <strong>Internationalized Resource
Identifier</strong>. The IRI technology essentially extends the Uniform
Resource Identifier (URI), allowing for a greater set of characters. In
other words, it serves the same function as the URI. However, URIs can
only consist of ASCII characters, whereas IRIs allow for a wide variety
of characters, including Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Cyrillic
characters.</li>
<li>Associating (metadata) terms with a PID in such a way enables the
machine to unambiguously and persistently identify the term. This opens
up advanced information technologies. Different terms can be put into
relations with each otherâ¦</li>
<li>In this example the term âallosteric moleculeâ is specified to be a
subclass of âbiological roleâ. Hence, a relational connection of the
type âsublass ofâ is formed between the terms âallosteric moleculeâ and
âbiological roleâ.</li>
<li>Based on the associated PIDs the machine is now able to assign
meaning to a specific term.</li>
<li>The study of meaning, reference, or truth is called
<strong>Semantics</strong>. By formally describing concepts,
relationships between different (meta)data entities, and categories, we
add meaning to the information. This technology is known as the
<strong>Semantic Web</strong>.</li>
<li>In the words of Tim Berners-Lee and his peers: âThe Semantic Web is
an extension of the current Web in which information is given
well-defined meaning, better enabling computers and people to work in
cooperation.â</li>
<li>In this course we have been focusing on data formats such as JSON,
XML and Markdown to describe our data. Adding meaning to these data
object calls for enhanced describtive technologies and the W3C has
well-defined and endorsed the standards of the Semantic Webâ¦</li>
<li>but this is another story and shall be told in another course.</li>
<li><em>Allow some time for questions.</em></li>

    2022-11-07: we have gotten a notification that we have an overage for our
    tracking and I'm pretty sure this has to do with Workbench usage.
    Considering that I am not _currently_ using this tracking because I do not
    yet know how to access the data, I am turning this off for now.
  <script>
    var _paq = window._paq = window._paq || [];
    /* tracker methods like "setCustomDimension" should be called before "trackPageView" */
    _paq.push(["setDocumentTitle", document.domain + "/" + document.title]);
    _paq.push(["setDomains", ["*.preview.carpentries.org","*.datacarpentry.github.io","*.datacarpentry.org","*.librarycarpentry.github.io","*.librarycarpentry.org","*.swcarpentry.github.io", "*.carpentries.github.io"]]);
    _paq.push(["setDoNotTrack", true]);
    _paq.push(["disableCookies"]);
    _paq.push(['trackPageView']);
    _paq.push(['enableLinkTracking']);
    (function() {
          var u="https://carpentries.matomo.cloud/";
          _paq.push(['setTrackerUrl', u+'matomo.php']);
          _paq.push(['setSiteId', '1']);
          var d=document, g=d.createElement('script'), s=d.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];
          g.async=true; g.src='https://cdn.matomo.cloud/carpentries.matomo.cloud/matomo.js'; s.parentNode.insertBefore(g,s);
        })();
